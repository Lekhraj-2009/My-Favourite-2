      <p>I love playing music. It is the art of arranging sounds in time. Music can raise someone's mood, get them excited or make them calm and relaxed. There are many musical instruments like Piano, Guitar, Keyboard, Drums, Cymbals, Flute, Violin, Tabla, Harmonium, Banjo, Sitar, etc.</p>
      <p>I know to play the keyboard very well. I have been playing it from 2<sup>nd</sup> Standard and have a great experience. I have won several awards in music and have also represented my school in various music competitions. I have also given many live performances of music.</p>
      <p>Music is a great way to express your feelings and emotions. It reduces stress, makes one patient and also helps boost concentration. So more and more people should take up music as it is not only a great source of entertainment, but also changes you mood and increses your mental capability.</p>
